The Salary Calculator application takes in user inputs of first name, last name, id number, job title, and annual salary and adds them to the employee list when the information is entered and the submit button is clicked. The employees list displays all entered information and allows the user to delete an employee by clicking the delete button. At the bottom of the employee list, there is a monthly salaries calculator that calculates the total monthly salaries of all employees entered in the form (please note, when an employee is deleted, the total monthly salaries calculation at the bottom of the page is not adjusted for the deleted employee). If the total monthly salaries reaches $20,000 or more, the monthly salaries line will turn red.
